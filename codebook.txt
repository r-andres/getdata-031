The tidy dataset collects data about human activity recognition experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the authors of the experiment captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Each record provided contains

- 60-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Notes
=====
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- First line contains the name of each feature.
- Only meaningful mean() and std() features have been left.
- The "BodyBody" features have been also intently filtered as long as a concrete
  definition could not be deduced from the original features description.
