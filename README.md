The 'run_analysis.R' script does the following:
* Retrieves from the internet the source data package
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to run 'run_analysis.R'

IMPORTANT:  The script, as first steps, retrieves the required data package from internet and decompresses it. 
The 'run_analysis.R' script can be run as long as the Samsung data is prepared in your working directory.
